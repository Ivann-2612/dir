                A large, multinational, UK-based sports betting and gaming
                operator, upon acquiring a competitor (itself one of world`s
                leading online betting operators), was looking for synergies in
                the combined technology function, aiming to improve the overall
                service and reduce costs. Fincore Ltd, a London-based software
                specialists, were chosen as the prime outsourcing partner and
                they, in turn, selected Finbet as the near-shore outsourcing
                partner.

                Working with the client, Fincore and Finbet implemented a smooth
                transition from the legacy servicing framework to a streamlined,
                agile and responsive process for managing the entire life-cycle
                of client’s enterprise platform.

                As a result, Fincore’s client achieved an overall reduction in
                time-to-market, reduced execution risks and significantly
                reduced IT costs.
